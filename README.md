# School_Python_Assignment_SolvingPuzzles

Objective: Given the puzzle files in puzzle folder and the A* algorithm in MinPQ.py, you need to examine whether or not the puzzle is getting closer to the final or goal state. By measuring some distance from our current state(given puzzle configurations in puzzle folder) to the goal state(solved puzzle), the A* algorithm will find moves that reduces the distance to the goal.
